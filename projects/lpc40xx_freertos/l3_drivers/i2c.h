/**

 *
 * Most typical implementation of an I2C device is that after the device address is sent, the first byte
 * is interpreted as a register number we wish to read or write. Devices that deviate from this
 * implementation may require enhancing this I2C driver.
 *
 * Some devices indicate an 8-bit address, so this an be directly passed to the API as 'slave_address'
 * In this case, we include the read/write bit with the address.
 *
 * Others indicate 7-bit address, and so you should then pass 'addr_7_bit << 1' to 'slave_address' because
 * the LSB bit is a read/write bit.
